However, the source code is open-source and you are allowed to use it however you wish.

:::info Would you like me to host this bot?

The bot includes a full-fledged Dashboard as well as a fully functional ticket system.

Users in the `.env` file are the so called "Owners", and only they can give access to the Dashboard for users, as it all works via oauth.
