# Alyx

This bot is a global `reporting` and `banning` bot. It's source is private, because of multiple reasons.
However, I would be willing to show how the bot is setup and help you with your project!

Alyx is a public bot, in where people can report a user violating a rule, for example Discord ToS.

Moderators will be able to either accept the report, and the bot will ban the user from their server, or deny the report, and nothing will happen.

:::caution
Every report needs a valid proof with a link, for example [Imgur](https://imgur.com). Otherwise the report will fail and not be sent.
:::

In the future, this bot will also have Dashboard with a list of banned users, and the ability to ban users via the Dashboard.
Keep in mind, that the dashboard is not publicly accessable and will only be allowed for users that we allow.

:::tip
If you want access to this bot, please ask fayevr#0001 on Discord.
