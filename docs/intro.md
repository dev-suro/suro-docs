# Let's talk business.

You like the documentation page? Well thank you!
However, the base was made by [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus), so go check that out!

## Getting Started

Where.. would you like to start?

We have [Discord bots](http://localhost:3000/docs/category/discord-bots) and [Websites](http://localhost:3000/docs/category/websites)

### What you'll need for the bots

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## What you'll need for the websites

- Any IDE to properly edit the files needed (Please try to change as much as possible, so it's not a copy from us.)
  - Try to read all README files attached to each project.
